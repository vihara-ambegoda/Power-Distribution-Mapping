# Production Line Power Distribution Mapping

This project was completed as part of my internship at Cable Solutions (Pvt) Ltd. in 2019.  

It documents the **Power Distribution Hierarchy** of the company production line and provides the final **AutoCAD Power Distribution Drawing** integrating both production-level and company-level power systems.

The work involved inspecting distribution panels, mapping connections, and creating a unified technical drawing for maintenance and future expansion.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Tasks
- **Inspection & Data Collection**  
  - Checked two main distribution panels in the production line.  
  - Documented connected machinery, sub-power panels, and lighting panels using tree diagrams.  
  - Verified panel-to-machine connections with assistance from machine operators.

- **Hierarchy Creation**  
  - Compiled findings into a detailed **Power Distribution Hierarchy**.  

- **CAD Drawing Development**  
  - Converted the hierarchy into an **AutoCAD drawing**.  
  - Integrated existing company-level distribution layout, including:  
    - CEB (Ceylon Electricity Board) supply lines  
    - Generators  
    - UPS room and backup systems  

- **Final Updates**  
  - Incorporated newly added power panels into the drawing.  
  - Delivered the final **Power Distribution Diagram**.
